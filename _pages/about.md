<p><div style="text-align:justify">Completed Ph.D. in Earth Sciences from IIT Gandhinagar. Currently working as a Research Associate at IIT Gandhinagar.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align:justify">I focus on developing novel methodologies to explore and elucidate the role of climate change-induced extreme events. My research has employed Climate modeling to attribute changes in the concurrent extreme events, land-atmospheric coupling of atmospheric aridity, heat stress, and sustainable water management under different warming scenarios. I also have special interest in the implementation of <b>Machine and Deep Learning </b>techniques to improve understanding of various short and long-term disasters such as drought, flash floods etc. and through my work provide important insights for sustainable environmental policies."</div></p>
