# Teaching

Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their
analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on
experience. I have taught undergraduate and Graduate students as a teaching assistant and tutor. While at IIT Gandhinagar, I served as a teaching assistant for courses for graduate students and led remote sensing data analysis through google earth engine and ENVI software.
